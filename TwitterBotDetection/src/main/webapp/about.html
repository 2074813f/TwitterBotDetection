<h1>About</h1>

<p id="about-text" class=""> Recently the discovery of large networks of
  automated users (bots) have been investigated over their influence on the
  social media platform Twitter. The "Twitter Bot Detection" project allows
  users to identify bots or humans using automated classification of Twitter
  accounts. The project utilises machine learning algorithms to produce a model
  for classifying users. Twitter accounts and statuses are retrieved and cached
  to produce a raw dataset from which a number of features used to identify
  bot-like behaviour are generated. After implementation of the classifier and
  production of a user interface to demonstrate the capabilities of the system,
   experiments were conducted to evaluate several aspects of the system,
   recognising considerations for feature transformation and limitations of the
   training dataset.</p>
